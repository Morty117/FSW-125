# MERN Fullstack Development
    - MongoDB = Database Layer
    - Express = Middleware for Nodejs
    - React = FrontEnd (User Interface)
    - Node.js = web server logic

# Frontend vs Backend - What a server does
    - Frontend developers build how a website LOOKS
    - Backend developers build how a website WORKS
    - What is a server?
        = a server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network
        = well known type of server is web servers where webpages can be accessed over the internet through a client like a web browser
        = Common Types of Servers
            - Web Server - web server who pages and run apps through web browsers. Web servers are used for many task in addition to delivering simple text and images, such as uploading and backing up files online through a cloud storage service or online backup service
            
            - Email Server - email servers send and receive email messages. If you have an email client on your computer, the software connects to an IMAP/POP server to download your messages to your computer, and an SMTP server to send messages back through the email server
            
            - FTP server - FTP servers move files through File Transfer Protocol tools. FTP servers are accessible remotely using FTP client programs, which connect to the file share on the server, either through the server's built-in FTP capabilities or with a dedicated FTP server program.

            - Identity Server - Identity servers support logins and security roles for authorized users

# Intro to Server-side Programming
    - NodeJS is a JS runtime built on Chrome's V8 JS engine
    - Node allows us to execute JS on our computer which is not a built in functionality
    - Backend usually consists of servers or servers/databases
    - Servers are code that receive requests from clients or another server and send back a response
    - When the servers recieve these requests they use and API (Application Programming Interface). This interface takes the servers requests, fulfills them and allows the server to send a response back to the client
    - the database is the last piece to the backend puzzle and allow us to store information or persist information/data
    = REMOTE VS LOCAL: REMOTE is anything that is not on your device and LOCAL is anything running on your machine
